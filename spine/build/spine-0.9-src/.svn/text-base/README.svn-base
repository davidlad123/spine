===========================================================================================================
Spine is an extensible java application framework for creating easily transposable applications which can easily be ported from one view model to another.

Spine provides a means of using inversion of control (dependency injection) techniques to create an application from the presentation tier to the nth tier by using a generic model to instantiate java classes specified in configuration along a defined process flow.

========================================================================================================
Spine makes use of several libraries which are packaged with the distribution, they are:

    * Log4J libraries (packaged with distribution)
    * Junit libraries (packaged with distribution)
    * Apache Commons Library (packaged with distribution)
    * Hibernate 3 Libraries (packaged with distribution)

The framework also requires that you have J2SE5.0 or later installed, and if developing a Web Application, you should have J2EE1.4 packaged with your application.
