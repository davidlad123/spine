  <p>Spine is an extensible java application framework  for creating easily transposable applications which can easily be ported from one view model to another.</p><p>
  Spine provides a means of using inversion of control (dependency injection) techniques to create an application from the presentation tier to the nth tier by using a generic
  model to instantiate java classes specified in configuration along a defined process flow.</p>
